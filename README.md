# B-Trees-Implementation

C++ code implementing B+ trees without using the STL libraries.

Operations:
  1.  Creates a B+ tree of the given order
  2.  Add an element to the B+ tree
  3.  Insert an element in the proper location and adjust the tree accordingly
  4.  Write the B+ tree structure to a file so that it can be re-read and new elements can be inserted again.
  
Compilation command: g++ assn_4.cpp -o assn_4
Executing the code: ./assn_4 index_file.bin order

order can be any positive number that could define the order of the B+ tree to be created. Say, 4.
